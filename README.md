MLOps Final Project - Amani, Diarra, Sakura
### Today, the internet offers an overwhelming number of items, options, and supplies, making our choices virtually limitless. Sometimes, even with a search function, we may not know what to look for. A recommender system plays a vital role in this scenario. Web personalization is increasingly reliant on recommender systems to create custom experiences, drive content engagement, enhance interactions, and improve sales. Recommender systems bring visibility to products and services that may be overshadowed by more popular ones.  In this project, we will be creating a recommendation engine for products using AWS SageMaker to recommend movies using Kaggle datasets, Netflix Original Films & IMDB Scores, and Anime Recommendation Database 2020.
